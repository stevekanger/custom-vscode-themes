# custom-vscode-themes README

I like the default syntax highlighting of vscodes Dark+ theme so I just converted a couple themes that I liked into having the default syntax highlighting.

## Usage

Clone the repository into the extensions folder. In Windows that folder is `C:\Users\Your_Username\.vscode\extensions\custom-vscode-themes`.

**Enjoy!**
